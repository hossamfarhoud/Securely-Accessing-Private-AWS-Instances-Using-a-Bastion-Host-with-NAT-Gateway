# Securely-Accessing-Private-AWS-Instances-Using-a-Bastion-Host-with-NAT-Gateway

ðŸš€ *Project Overview*:  
This project demonstrates how to securely connect to private instances within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using a Bastion Host, configured with a NAT Gateway and SSH Forwarding techniques.

ðŸ”§ *What You'll Learn*:
- Configuring a VPC with public and private subnets.
- Setting up a Bastion Host in a public subnet for secure access.
- Creating and configuring NAT Gateways for routing traffic to private instances.
- Establishing secure SSH connections from a public to a private instance.

ðŸ“– *Step-by-Step Guide*:
1. *VPC Setup*:
   - Create a VPC with public and private subnets.
   - Set up route tables and associate them with the respective subnets.

2. *Internet Gateway and NAT Configuration*:
   - Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC for external connectivity.
   - Set up NAT Gateway and configure routes for private subnet traffic.

3. *Instance Deployment*:
   - Launch a Bastion Host in the public subnet.
   - Deploy a test instance in the private subnet.

4. *Security Group Configuration*:
   - Modify security groups to allow SSH access to the Bastion Host.
   - Secure the private instance by restricting direct access.

5. *SSH Access Setup*:
   - Use SSH forwarding from the Bastion Host to securely access the private instance.
   - Troubleshoot connectivity issues and ensure secure communication.

ðŸ”— *Why Use a Bastion Host with NAT Gateway?*:
- *Enhanced Security*: Provides a secure method to access private instances without exposing them to the internet.
- *Cost Efficiency*: Reduces the need for multiple public IPs by centralizing access.
- *Scalability*: Easily scale your infrastructure while maintaining secure access.
